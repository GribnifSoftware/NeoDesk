Notes on translating NeoDesk files
----------------------------------

Please make sure to translate all text and resource files on both disks,
including the ones in the EXTRAS folder. If something is not translated,
we will have to ship the final disks to you with it in English.

When translating resource files, you must use a resource editor that keeps
the order of the trees in tact; we recommend K-Resource. The Atari resource
editor will rearrange the order of free strings within the resource, and should
therefore not be used.

All resources can be edited in monochrome, though it may be desirable to
edit NEODESKL and NEODESKM in medium rez. DO NOT edit a file containing
high rez coordinates (NEODESKH, ICONEDIT, NEOQ_H, NEOCNTRL, etc.) in medium
rez!

If the resource editor tells you that moving a particular object will cause
the tree structure to be reorganized, cancel the operation! This can cause
all kinds of problems.

Please try to keep the vertical sizes and positions of buttons as they are
now. There will be many cases where the translated string will cause a button
to expand horizontally, and in this case you may have to adjust the horizontal
position to preserve centering. Be very careful not to move an object
vertically, especially if you are editing a medium resolution file in high
rez, as the resources are oftentimes not "snapped".

Please do not change any of the object flags unless you are sure it is an
error.

If something still does not look right, don't worry too much since I will be
going over the translated files with a fine tooth comb, anyway. Some of the
strings in .MSG files affect the sizes of boxes in the resource, and so these
cases may not be obvious.

Alerts in resources and in MSG files must consist of no more than 5 lines of
30 characters each. The buttons must be no more than 30 characters total.

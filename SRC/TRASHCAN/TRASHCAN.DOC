Description
-----------

    The NeoDesk Recoverable Trashcan is a special desk accessory which 
  hooks directly into NeoDesk 3.  It adds to NeoDesk a brand new trashcan
  which can restore any files that were deleted through it.


Version 1.3 Notes
-----------------

    This version can be run as a "NeoDesk Program" by simply renaming its 
  file ending to ".NPG".  Just rename it and drag the its icon to the 
  desktop.  Use it as usual.


Version 1.2 Notes
-----------------

    This new version corrects a problem with the Turbo C startup code which
  would cause memory allocation errors.  This problem became evident when 
  the trashcan was used with MultiDesk.


Version 1.1 Notes
-----------------

    This new version has been recompiled with Borland's Turbo-C for smaller
  size (and slightly faster speed).  It also corrects a bug that would 
  occur if you tried deleting a "desktop" icon for a drive that had not had
  its window opened yet.


Installing it
-------------

    To install the Recoverable Trashcan accessory copy the TRASHCAN.ACC and
  TRASHCAN.RSC files to your boot disk.  A boot disk is whatever disk you
  normally utilize to turn on your computer.  This could be a hard disk or 
  a floppy disk.  Consult your NeoDesk manual if you have any questions.

    You then need to tell NeoDesk about this accessory.  This is done by 
  entering its name (TRASHCAN) in the "Accessorries..." dialog box under 
  the "Set Preferences..." menu entry.

    Once you have installed both the Recoverable Trashcan accessory you 
  can then reboot your system and load NeoDesk.  Once loaded you can open a
  window to your boot disk and drag the TRASHCAN.ACC file to your desktop.
  Make sure you place it in a convenient place on the desktop, since the
  icon for the Recoverable Trashcan accessory will now become your new
  trashcan.  You should also make sure your desktop under "Save 
  Configuration..." so that the icon will remain there every time you
  reboot the system.


Operation
---------

    Use the Recoverable Trashcan just like the older standard trashcan.  
  Any items (files or folders) you drag to it will be deleted from your
  windows.  It works on hard disks, ram disks, and floppy disks.  The big
  difference is that these deleted items will still be available "inside"
  the trashcan.  You can access the trashcan contents by double-clicking on
  the trashcan or opening its desk accessory entry under the "NeoDesk" 
  menu.

    You may also choose to remove the older trashcan (so you will not get 
  confused and delete something in the wrong trashcan) by selecting it and 
  choosing the "Remove" option under the "Install Desktop Icon..." menu 
  entry.

    You CANNOT use this new trashcan to 'remove' desktop icons from your 
  desktop.  That is still a feature of the original trashcan.  The 
  Recoverable Trashcan will attempt to delete the actual item associated
  with any icon you drag to it, regardless of whether it is a desktop icon
  or not.  You can still select any icon from the desktop and remove it
  using the "Install Desktop Icon..." menu entry.

    The contents of the trashcan are displayed in a special dialog box.  
  The drive buttons to the right indicate what drive you are presently
  looking looking at.  The scroll area to the left will list any deleted
  items (files or folders) in that drive which can be recovered with the
  Recoverable Trashcan.  These items are sorted alphabetically by path and
  name.  Folders will be indicated by the standard "folder character" to
  the left of any folder names.

    If there are more items than fit in the scroll area you can use the 
  arrows in the vertical scroll bar to see them.  In theory the 
  Recoverable Trashcan can handle an unlimited number of deleted items per
  drive.  The horizontal scroll bar lets you read any filenames which (due
  to their long path) are too long to fit in the scroll area.

    By clicking on the appropriate "d", "t", or "s" button you can change 
  the display to the right of an item's name to show that item's date, 
  time, or size.

    If any items are displayed with a "gray field" over the filename that 
  signifies that the items' paths no longer exist.  That means that when 
  you restore them, you will have to create the folders that they require.
  In color, this "gray field" is displayed with as a "red field".

    There is also an option, to the right, to turn on or off the 
  confirmation the trashcan gives every time you drag something to it.  
  This option is permanently saved in the TRASHCAN.RSC file whenever you
  change it and then quit out of the trashcan.

    You can select any item or group of items by using the mouse.  Any item
  you select will remain selected even if you scroll the list.  You can 
  use the [Shift] key to add and remove single items from a group of items.
  Selecting any item will turn on the two buttons at the lower part of the
  dialog box, [Undelete] and [Delete Permanently].

    The first option, Undelete, allows you to recover all the items that 
  you have selected.  An item is restored to the same drive and folder as
  where it was deleted from.  If there already is an item with the same
  name as the deleted item you will receive a name conflict box.  At this
  point you can either rename the file, skip that file, or abort the entire
  operation.  There is also the possibility that the path of the deleted
  item no longer exists.  In this case the trashcan will give you the 
  option to create the folders needed to recover that item (or you can just
  abort recovering it).

    The second option, Delete Permanently, allows you to delete all the 
  items you have selected from the Recoverable Trashcan.  This is similar 
  to using the older standard trashcan.  Since you will be unable to
  recover any items deleted with this option, use it with care.  Using this
  command will also return any disk space that was used by deleted items.


Usage
-----

    You should try to always make it a habit of deleting your files & 
  folders through the Recoverable Trashcan.  That way there is less of a 
  chance that you will accidentally delete an item that you did not mean 
  to delete.

    It is important to remember that deleted items (which are in the 
  Recoverable Trashcan) will still consume valuable disk space.  You 
  should check the trashcan at least once a week and delete any items that
  you are not planning to recover.  If you run out of disk space you should
  probably consider emptying out the trashcan.

    You might even find it convenient to remove the built-in NeoDesk 
  trashcan from the desktop so that you do not get confused and delete
  something important by accident.

    Remember that if you delete permanently a folder full of files NeoDesk
  still has to delete every individual file inside of it one by one.  This 
  means that very large folders might take some extra time to delete.  The
  folder name will remain displayed in the Recoverable Trashcan while it is
  busy deleting all of its contents.

    The Recoverable Trashcan will temporarily delete any read-only files
  without any additional warning.  When you select "Delete Permanently" it 
  will then ask for confirmation before removing any read-only files
  permanently.


How it works
------------

    Whenever you delete a file or folder the Recoverable Trashcan deletes 
  that item's name from the "file directory" leaving all of its sectors 
  marked as "in use" so that no other file will overwrite it.  It then
  writes to a hidden TRASHCAN.DAT file, in the root directory of that disk,
  all the information needed to later recover that "deleted" item.  The
  TRASHCAN.DAT file holds all the information for all the deleted items in
  that particular drive.  If you delete or recover the last item in the
  trashcan for that drive, the TRASHCAN.DAT file is removed.

    By looking for a TRASHCAN.DAT file in any disk, the trashcan is able to
  tell if any items have been deleted in that disk (and are waiting to be 
  recovered).  With the data in that file it can then "undelete" any 
  deleted items.  If there are no deleted items in a drive (waiting to be
  restored) then there will be no TRASHCAN.DAT for that drive.

    To delete an item permanently it actually restores the item first and
  then erases it from the disk.  The restore stage is needed to insure that
  everything is back to normal before it is actually deleted.  This method 
  also assures that the Recoverable Trashcan never has to touch the very
  sensitive File Allocation Table (FAT).


Warning!
--------

    You should never attempt to reorganize or repair a drive using programs
  like TuneUp, DL_II, or ICD CleanUp when you have files in the Recoverable
  Trashcan!  These programs will interpret any deleted files, that are 
  still inside the trashcan, as "lost clusters".  If you go ahead and
  reorganize a disk with one of these programs or "fix" the lost clusters,
  any deleted items (waiting to be recovered) will be lost or damaged.  
  Also the information in the TRASHCAN.DAT file, for that drive, will no
  longer be accurate.  Only use programs like TuneUp, DL_II, or ICD CleanUp
  after you have emptied out the Recoverable Trashcan.

    Because all the information for the deleted items of a disk is stored 
  in a hidden TRASHCAN.DAT file you have to be careful that you do not copy
  that file to another drive.  For example, the NeoDesk DiskCopy function
  will copy the TRASHCAN.DAT if you use the "Files Only" function.  The
  same effect is caused by dragging a disk icon to any open window.  If you
  do so, the Recoverable Trashcan information for that disk (the one it was
  copied to) will be inaccurate.

    You can, however, perform disk copies as long as you use the "With 
  Format" or "No Format" options.  In either case the TRASHCAN.DAT along 
  with all the deleted items will be copied.  This is because those
  commands make exact duplicates of the disk (an "image" copy), including
  all of its contents.

    Under the worst case scenario you will only lose the deleted items 
  inside the trashcan.  You can always restore a drive back to its correct 
  state (if for some reason the Recoverable Trashcan is not working 
  correctly) by using a utility like TuneUp or DL_II to restore the "lost
  clusters" and by deleting the hidden TRASHCAN.DAT file.


TOS bug information
-------------------

    Because the Recoverable Trashcan requires that a "media change" be 
  executed so that NeoDesk & TOS both realize that files have been deleted 
  or recovered, there is the possibility that you may run into a nasty TOS
  1.0/1.2 bug.

    The bug occurs when special circumstances in a drive's file structure 
  cause the system to crash whenever a media change is executed.  NeoDesk 
  2.05 will execute a media change whenever you press [Esc] on any drive's
  window.  Thus, you can see if any of your drives have this problem by
  pressing [Esc] from NeoDesk 2.05 on each drive's window.  This problem
  can also be caused if there are more than 98 folders in any directory.

    You cannot use the Recoverable Trashcan on any drives showing this 
  symptom.  If you do, the Recoverable Trashcan will attempt to detect 
  this and tell you, though there is a chance that it might crash.  In
  either case nothing will happen to any of your files.

    This bug is related to the "40 Folder Bug" and is NOT fixed by FOLDRXXX
  or any other 40 folder fix.  This problem was corrected in TOS 1.4 (and 
  newer ROM versions).  Atari has admitted the problem and stated that the 
  only solution is to "upgrade to TOS 1.4 or above".
